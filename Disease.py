    Prompt for Medical Practitioners: Analyzing Disease Symptoms

    Objective: Evaluate patient symptoms to identify possible diseases or health issues.

    Tasks:

    Detailed Analysis: Thoroughly examine each symptom to detect any abnormalities or signs indicative of disease.
    Findings Report: Clearly document all abnormalities and disease signs identified during the analysis.
    Recommendations and Next Steps: Propose necessary further tests or medical evaluations to confirm the diagnosis or expand understanding of the symptoms.
    Treatment Suggestions: Based on the symptoms and findings, suggest potential treatment options or interventions.
    Guidelines:

    Scope: Ensure the analysis pertains only to human health issues.
    Clarity: If symptom details are insufficient for a definitive analysis, indicate this as a limitation in the findings.

    Purpose: This structured analysis supports clinical decision-making by providing a systematic approach to symptom evaluation.
